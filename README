Spark
=======

Spark lets you seed your database with a set of data, either programatically or via fixtures.

Example
=======

It's insanely easy to use. 

After installation, there will be directories created for each rails environment like so:

db/
  spark/
    development/
    test/
    production/

Place a script (.rb) or a fixture (.yml) into the appropriate directory for the environment you wish to seed, run 'rake spark' and voila: you've seeded your DB.

Not much more to it than that.  Enjoy.
